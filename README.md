Laws are a codification of a societyâ€™s norms. They capture the current state of those norms in a way that can be communicated and interpreted with some degree of consistency. Programming languages do a very similar job; they capture a set of operations and decisions in a way that can be consistently executed. Beluga explores the benefits of capturing law in programming languages, and demonstrates how it can be applied to urban planning laws.<br>

Beluga is a scriptloped to support a better experience for both designers and policy makers. Using LEP controls and associating them with cadastral lot geometry, 3D legal forms can be generated. The script building regulations to generate 3D forms which represent the maximum buildable space. We refer to these as permissible building envelopes. The LEP controls specified are changeable parameters, allowing the impact of alterations to be seen in real time.
